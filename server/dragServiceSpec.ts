            the edit state plan:: 


        - elements to edit is passed to lists in general by @Input() 
        - Every editable thing is a subclass of IEDitabnleContainer which actually takes EditService and registers itself in element state
        - On UpdateElements in edit state, always available elements && boards is updated.
        - later on UpdateElements will be hook up point for implementing redo actions and shit.
