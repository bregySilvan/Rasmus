## Update
- Go for List service. Whenever a list is created, it registers itself with given elements and keys since it inherits Globaleditable. So list actions, state and effects should be added which are responsible for updating existing lists. Whenever new elements from hosts are loaded these elemetns should probably update containers. List service takes existing list keys from it's state and according to these lists it just appends new elements. There is also a keyservice which creates a key for every type of list. A Key consists of a static praefix which expresses type with 16 random chars followed.
